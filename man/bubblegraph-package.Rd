\description{
Machinery for mining CWB corpora
}
\details{
The driller-package provides functions for basic text statistics for corpora
that are managed by the Corpus Workbench (CWB). A core feature is to generate
subcorpora/partitions based on metadata. The package is also meant to serve
as an interface between the CWB and R-packages implementing more
sophisticated statistical procedures (e.g. lsa, lda, topicmodels) or
providing further functionality for text mining (e.g. tm).

Any analysis using this package will usually start with setting up a
subcorpus/partition (with \code{partition}). A set of partitions can be
generated with \code{partitionCluster}. Once a partition or a set of partitions
has been set up, core functions are \code{context} and
\code{keyness}. Based on a partition cluster, a
term-document matrix (class 'TermDocumentMatrix' from the tm package) can be
generated (with \code{as.TermDocumentMatrix}). This opens the door to the wealth of
statistical methods implemented in R.
